Welcome to the repository for scripts and data for the UKCEH West Africa Hydrological Forecasting Training Workshop 2026.

This series of hands-on workshops introduces the fundamentals of accessing, modelling, and analysing hydrological data and approaches. Each session is designed to build practical skills through guided exercises and additional resources. Below you will find brief summaries of each workshop, along with links to the corresponding resources that we will explore together during the training.

These notebooks were developed for the UKCEH Summer School and are intended for interactive use during the training sessions. They are designed to run on <a href=https://colab.google/>Google Colab</a>, which allows you to get started quickly without any local setup. For guidance on how to run the notebooks on Colab, see the [Running the Training Notebooks on Google Colab](#running-on-colab) section below.

You are also very welcome to explore the notebooks at your own pace, on any platform of your choice, as long as the required packages are installed. This repository includes a requirements.txt file listing all the necessary dependencies for the various workshops. To install these locally, run the following command:

   > !python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

If you would like help setting up the environment on your local machine or another platform, we are happy to provide support.

## Training Objectives
The high-level objectives of this summer school are:
- Demonstrate how to access and work with remote datasets using Python
- Provide an overview of key datasets commonly used in hydrological science
- Offer hands-on experience with standard tools and packages through practical applications
- Introduce fundamental concepts in water resources modelling
- Seasonal forecasting????

## Running the Training Notebooks on Google Colab
To run the training notebooks using *Google Colab*, follow these steps:
1. **Log in to your Google account** and open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. In Colab, go to **File > Open notebook**.
3. Select the **GitHub** tab.
4. Paste the URL of the specific notebook (ending in `.ipynb`) from this repository into the search bar.
5. Click on the notebook you want to open.

> **Important:** Before you start editing, make sure to **Save a copy to your own Google Drive**.

6. Go to **File > Save a copy in Drive**. This will open a new tab with the title `Copy of <Notebook Name>`.
7. You are now working on your own copy of the notebook, which you can rename if you choose.
8. You can safely close the original (read-only) notebook tab and continue working on your personal copy.
9. The copied notebook will be saved in your Google Drive and can be accessed anytime.

## Introduction to the Workshops
This series of different interactive workshops is designed to introduce participants to data-driven approaches in hydrological science. Each session focuses on a specific aspect of working with hydrological data, from modelling concepts to accessing, exploring, and applying datasets in research contexts.

### Theme 1: Hydrological Datasets
**Facilitators:** *Eugene Magee | Amulya Chevuturi*

Follow-along session on accessing and retrieving remote hydrological datasets using Python, including common tools and protocols for working with data hosted on public or institutional servers. Hands-on session on exploring different types of hydroclimate datasets, including basic techniques for processing, visualisation, and analysis. Here is the link to ???.

### Theme 2: Water Resource Modelling
**Facilitators:** *Helen Baron | Nathan Rickards*

An introduction to reservoir storage forecasting, with a hands-on application of machine learning using a tree-based data-driven approach. Data selection, feature engineering and selection, hyper parameter tuning and model evaluation will all be explored in the context of building a robust machine learning tool to help forecast reservoir storage at a monthly to seasonal timestep. Here is the link to ???.


### Theme 3: Seasonal Forecast Applications
**Facilitators:** *Eugene Magee | Ezra Kitson | Lucy Barker*

This day provides R workbooks that introduce participants to running a lumped catchment hydrological model, using it to generate simple sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasts, and visualising forecast outputs. The first session introduces participants to the GR6J hydrological model, calibrating and running it with rainfall and potential evapotranspiration inputs. The second session then applies that calibrated model to "Ensemble Streamflow Prediction" forecasting, and the third session formats the forecast outputs into graphics suitable for decision making. Here is the link to ???.
